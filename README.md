# Enhanced Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm üöÄ

This repository contains an implementation of the **Enhanced Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm** in Python. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the time quantum for each process based on its remaining burst time.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Dynamic Time Quantum**: Adjusts time quantum based on the remaining burst time.
- **Performance Metrics**: Computes:
  - Average Turnaround Time (TT)
  - Average Waiting Time (WT)
  - Average Response Time (RT).
- **Efficient Process Scheduling**: Ensures fair CPU allocation.

## üìå How It Works  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Input Process Details**  
   - Enter the number of processes.  
   - Provide **arrival time (AT)** and **burst time (BT)** for each process.  
   - Set the **initial time quantum** for scheduling.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scheduling Execution**  
   - Processes are added to the queue based on arrival time.  
   - Each process executes for a dynamically calculated time quantum.  
   - If unfinished, the process re-enters the queue.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Output Results**  
   - The program calculates and displays:  
     ‚úÖ Average **Turnaround Time (TT)**  
     ‚úÖ Average **Waiting Time (WT)**  
     ‚úÖ Average **Response Time (RT)**

## üì• Example Usage  

### ‚úÖ **Input Example:**
The program will prompt you to enter the number of processes, arrival time, burst time, and the initial time quantum. Here's an example:

```
Enter the number of processes: 5
Enter arrival time for process 1: 1
Enter burst time for process 1: 2
Enter arrival time for process 2: 3
Enter burst time for process 2: 4
Enter arrival time for process 3: 5
Enter burst time for process 3: 6
Enter arrival time for process 4: 7
Enter burst time for process 4: 8
Enter arrival time for process 5: 9
Enter burst time for process 5: 10
Enter the initial time quantum: 3
```

### üì§ **Output Example:**
After entering the input, the program will compute and display the following:

```
Enhanced RR Metrics:
Average Turnaround Time: 6.8000
Average Waiting Time: 2.4000
Average Response Time: 0.8000
```
